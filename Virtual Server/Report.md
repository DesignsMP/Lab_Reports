<h1>Virtual Windows Server</h1>
  <h4>Objectives:</h4>
    The objective for this lab was to understand virtual machines and servers and how they allow you to run several different machines all on one computer or server. With the possibility it also allows people to have multiple machines each with the ability to be customized to a specific need without affecting any of the other virtual machines.
  <h4>Equipment List:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pencil (to write down notes)</li>
    <li>Paper (to store notes)</li>
    <li>Hyper-V (to manage all of our virtual machines)</li>
    <li>Dell rack server (to store and run all of our virtual machines)</li>
    <li>Windows Server 2016 (the purpose of the virtual server and tool for the next lab)</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop (to communicate with rack server without having  to access it directly)</li>
  </ul>

    The only references we had with this lab was information given to us in class. This includes;
    <ul>
      <li> Names for the computers and accounts</li>
      <li> IP address information</li>
      <li> Product keys</li>
      <li> Passwords</li>

  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  A few things I am still confused on are:
  <ol>
  <li> How did people come up with the idea of virtual machines?</li>
  <li> How many virual machines are commonly used in a business?</li>
  <li> What all can one do with a server?</li>
  </ol>
