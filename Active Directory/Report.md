<h1>Active Directory Domain</h1>
  <h4>Objectives:</h4>
    The objective for this lab was to understand virtual machines and servers and how they allow you to run several different machines all on one computer or server. With the possibility it also allows people to have multiple machines each with the ability to be customized to a specific need without affecting any of the other virtual machines.
  <h4>Equipment List:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pencil (to write down notes)</li>
    <li>Paper (to store notes)</li>
    <li>Hyper-V (to manage all of our virtual machines)</li>
    <li>Dell rack server (to store and run all of our virtual machines)</li>
    <li>Windows Server 2016 (the purpose of the virtual server and tool for the next lab)</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop (to communicate with rack server without having  to access it directly)</li>
    <li>Active Directory (to manage groups, users, computers, and other devices)
  </ul>
