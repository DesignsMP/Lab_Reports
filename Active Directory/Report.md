<h1>Active Directory Domain</h1>
  <h4>Objectives:</h4>
  <p>Our objective for this lab was to promote a windows server up to the domain controller level. After that we were tasked with adding organizational units, users, and a client computer all with restrictions to their own departments files.
</p>
  <h4>Materials</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>Pencil (to write down notes)</li>
    <li>Paper (to store notes)</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop (to communicate with rack server without having  to access it directly)</li>
    <li>Active Directory (to manage groups, users, computers, and other devices)
  </ul>
  <h4>Notes and Observations:</h4>
    <p>
    During the lab we
<br>We changed the preferred dns server because the client 
<br>We had to (blank) so the client could login with a domain user.
<br>We used active directory because of the heirarchial structure which allows easy controll over each aspect of the server. We also use it due to it being able to replicate after any changes to the domain controller, that way if one controller was to crash another would be promoted to domain controller and there would not be a noticable affect on the actual server.
<br>Companies use virtual servers for several reasons including, saving money on multiple expenses, easier to transfer between hardware, and can be run with any type of OS that is either preferred or required by the company. When I say multiple expenses I mean, they money by not having to buy new hardware, they save money on electricity because with less amount of hardware they do not require as much cooling, and they save money by not having so many machines hooked up to the electricity.

  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  A few things I am still confused on are:
  <ol>
  <li> What does the heirarchy look like at a large business?</li>
  <li> Does one have to go through a screening process before gaining the abilities of controlling which global and local domains have access to certain materials?</li>
  <li> What purposes are there for the universal group?</li>
  <li> This method works for windows servers but what about other types of servers?</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Conclusion and Reflection:</h4>
    <p>
    In conclusion we were able to set up a server using active directory granting the ability to create pieces of the heirarchy and would later grant the ability to control permissions and attributes to different groups and organizational units. We created three organizational units along with a domain user under each one. With the server being operational we were also able to have a client computer, by signing in using a domain user, log onto the server a gain access to any materials that were being shared.
