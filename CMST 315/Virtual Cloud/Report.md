<h1>Virtual Cloud</h1>
  <h4>Objectives:</h4>
  <p>Our objective for this lab was to use Microsoft Azure to create a Linux or Windows cloud web-server.
</p>
  <h4>Materials</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>Pencil (to write down notes)</li>
    <li>Paper (to store notes)</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop (to communicate with rack server without having  to access it directly)</li>
    <li>Microsoft Azure (to create, configure, and run cloud-based virtual machines)
    <li>Bash ( to download, update, and edit the virtual machines/ web-server)
    <li>Computers (to access applications such as Microsoft Azure)
  </ul>
  <h4>Notes and Observations:</h4>

        Advantages:
            <ul>
              <li> Good</li>
            </ul>
        Disadvantages:
            <ul>
              <li> Bad</li>
            </ul>
     </li>      
     <li> Businesses need to consider ... before they switch IT to the cloud.</li>
     <li> Examples of built-in Azure configurations and services include:
          <ul>
            <li> </li>
            <li> </li>
            <li> </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
  <h4>Diagrams, flowcharts, and figures:</h4>
  Here is an image to demonstrate how I got the web-server up and running.

  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  A few things I am still confused on are:
  <ol>
  <li> Who was the first to implement a cloud based server?</li>
  <li> Would the cloud work well for something like a video game  server?</li>
  <li> Does Apple have any iOS cloud servers?</li>
  <li> Can a cloud server contain cloud servers?/li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Conclusion and Reflection:</h4>
    <p>
    In conclusion .
