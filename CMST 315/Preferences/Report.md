  <h4>Materials</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>Pencil (to write down notes)</li>
    <li>Paper (to store notes)</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop (to communicate with rack server without having  to access it directly)</li>
    <li>Active Directory (to manage groups, users, computers, and other devices)
    <li>Computers (to access applications such as active directory)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Notes and Observations:</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ol
     <li> The main differences between a GPO policy and a preference is the fact that policies can disable certain applications and settings for users, meanwhile a preference would hide those settings but the user could re-enable them if they so choosed. Another would be that policies can be set at both the domain and local level while preferences can only be set at the domain level.</li>
