<h1>J. Q. Adams Case Study</h1>
  <h4>Objectives:</h4>
  <p>Our objective for this lab was to demonstrate all of the skills and techniques we covered in our System Administration class regarding group policies, DFS, Active Directory, and using requires for a company to meet their IT needs.
</p>
  <h4>Materials</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>Pencil (to write down notes)</li>
    <li>Paper (to store notes)</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop (to communicate with rack server without having  to access it directly)</li>
    <li>Computers (to access applications such as Active directory)
  </ul>
  <h4>Notes and Observations:</h4>

  <h4>Diagrams, flowcharts, and figures:</h4>
  Here is an image to demonstrate how we set up our Active Directory structure and our file structure.

  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  A few things I am still confused on are:
  <ol>
  <li> Who was the first to implement a cloud based server?</li>
  <li> Would the cloud work well for something like a video game  server?</li>
  <li> Does Apple have any iOS cloud servers?</li>
  <li> Can a cloud server contain cloud servers?</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Conclusion and Reflection:</h4>
    <p>
    In conclusion I now understand the importants on how Cloud services can greatly benefit a company, but risks should still be assessed at all times. One of the major reasons why most businesses do not go with a cloud server to store their information is cost. It can get really expensive to use a service, like Microsoft Azure, for all of the companies files and applications. Plus the more virtual machines used the fast the data will get used up. For the lab we used a free account with our student status which gave us a $200.00 credit limit. By the end of the lab I was a little of $100.00 but I lost most of my credit when I accidentally had two virtual machines running at the same time. If a company can look past the price tag and truly believe that they would make more money being on the cloud, then a cloud-based company server would provide numerous advantages over those who do not implement cloud technology.
